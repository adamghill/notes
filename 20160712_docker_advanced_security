# Docker: Advanced Security

## Docker Security Scanning
- Project formerly known as Nautilus

### Docker Data Center (dtr - on-prem Hub-live tool)
- Universal Control Plane (deploy Docker)

## Knowing where your sources come from
- know your base (in Dockerfile)
- what is in each package (binary scan)
- image scanning and vulnerability detection
- CVE database is a plugin (Codenomicon)
- show all vulnerabilities in each component (binary-level scan)
- licensing information
- every 24 hours

## Best practices for image-building
- don't put anything in container that isn't needed for the app (i.e. no SSH)
- Alpine is smaller footprint and have less vulnerabilities
- upgrade components
- use official images
- data/database that persists should not be in the image (should be a volume)
- microservices - split out dependencies into other Docker containers
