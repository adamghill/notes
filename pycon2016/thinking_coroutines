# Thinking in Coroutines

- Responsiveness is important
- can't just spawn threads
- might need locks
- GIL is going away?

- Twisted started in 2008
- asyncio is just a nicer syntax, simpler way to think about it
- `yield from`
- 1 event loop that calls callbacks
- concurrancy and coroutines
- just this:
```
loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
loop.run_forever()
```
- `PYTHONASYNCIODEBUG=1` to debug slow Python calls
- coroutines:
```
async def anything(i):
    await asyncio.sleep(i)

loop.create_task(anything(i))
```

`loop.run_until_complete(anything(i))`
`asyncio.wait(tasks)`
`*task.result()`
`loop.run_until_complete(task)`
`task.exception()`

## What's included
- creating connections
- create listening connections
- file descriptors
- sub-processes
- locks, queues
- aiohttp
- aiopg, aiomysql

## Existing blocking API
- executors
- ThreadPoolExecutor, ProcessPoolExecutor

## Asyncio at Facebook
- 100k+ lines of code
- Instagram 33k+
- loop.signal_handler
- use Python 3.5+
