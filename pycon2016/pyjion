# Introducing a JIT API to CPython
- "Pigeon"
- backwards-compatibility
- Use CoreCLR HIT
- Create a C++ framework for CPythin JITs

## Other JITs
### PyPy
- Toolchain to build a toolchain
- not 100% compatibility

### Pyston
- Alpha-quality VM from Dropbox
    - AST
    - Baseline JIT
    - LLVM JIT

### Numba
- decorate any functions that get passed to LLVM

### Psyco & Unladen Swallow
- both shut down

## Overview
- support compability
- 3.5+ support only
- JIT at the code object level
- transalte Python bytecode to equivalent MSIL
- Both MSIL and Python bytecode is stack-based (although Python has 2 stacks)
- uses an abstract interpreter to...
- Use CPython C API to maintain compatibility
- Emit IR to directly call 
- Changes to C API

## Bumps in the road
- CPython has two stacks (one for execution and one for exception handling)
- CPython has some opcodes that result in non-constant number of items on the stack

## Future optimizations
- function inlining

### When?
- PEP for changes in CPython is out for review
- Numpy-compatible
- pythonjobs@microsoft.com
