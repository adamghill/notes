# HTTP/2 and Asynchronous APIs

## HTTP/2
- spec form for the past year
- RFC 7540 and 7541
- 60% browser support (Chrome, Chrome mobile, Edge, Safari, Opera, Firefox)
- binary instead of text
- one connection for parallel requests
- header compression
- server push
    - pro-actively push assets from server
    - goe sinto the cache
- mostly transparant (Apache, NGINX)
- HTTP/1.x (minifying, sprites, inlining)

## APIs
- `pycurl` -> HTTP/2 compatible
- `CURL_HTTP_VERSION_2_0`
- `CurlMulti`

## Negotiation
- can make some requests slower because backwards compatible
- h2 (TLS) and h2c (TCP)
- direct connect with HTTP/2

- CSS/JS minification is unecessary
- streams, frames, wait, dependency
- headers: hpack (index of hash able, can be custom)

- no more hacks
- performance gains
- 60% browser share
